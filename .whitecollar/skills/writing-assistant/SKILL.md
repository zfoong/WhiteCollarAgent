# Writing Assistant

Help users create, edit, and refine written content for various purposes.

## When to Use

- Drafting emails (professional, personal, follow-ups)
- Writing messages (formal or casual)
- Creating documents (reports, proposals, summaries)
- Editing existing text for clarity or tone
- Translating content between styles

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Understand the Context

Before writing, clarify:
- **Purpose**: What should this accomplish?
- **Audience**: Who will read this?
- **Tone**: Formal, casual, friendly, urgent?
- **Length**: Brief or detailed?
- **Key points**: What must be included?

### Step 2: Draft the Content

Create an initial draft that:
- Opens with the main point or purpose
- Organizes information logically
- Includes all necessary details
- Ends with clear next steps or call-to-action

### Step 3: Refine and Polish

- Check for clarity and conciseness
- Adjust tone to match audience
- Remove unnecessary words
- Ensure proper grammar and spelling
- Verify all key points are covered

## Content Types

### Professional Emails

```
Subject: [Clear, specific subject]

Hi [Name],

[Purpose statement - why you're writing]

[Key details or request]

[Next steps or call to action]

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

**Tips:**
- Keep subject lines under 50 characters
- Lead with the most important information
- Be specific about any requests or deadlines
- Use bullet points for multiple items

### Casual Messages

- Match the recipient's communication style
- Be conversational but clear
- Use appropriate greetings for the relationship
- Keep it brief unless detail is needed

### Formal Documents

Structure:
1. Executive summary / Introduction
2. Background / Context
3. Main content / Analysis
4. Conclusions / Recommendations
5. Next steps / Action items

### Thank You Notes

- Be specific about what you're thanking them for
- Mention the impact or why it mattered
- Keep it genuine and personal
- Send promptly

## Tone Guidelines

| Tone | Use When | Characteristics |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Formal | Business proposals, official requests | Complete sentences, no contractions, professional vocabulary |
| Professional | Work emails, client communication | Friendly but polished, clear and direct |
| Casual | Colleagues, friends | Conversational, contractions OK, relaxed |
| Urgent | Time-sensitive matters | Clear deadlines, action-oriented, concise |
| Apologetic | Mistakes, delays | Acknowledge issue, take responsibility, offer solution |

## Editing Checklist

- [ ] Is the main point clear in the first paragraph?

## Common Improvements

- **Too casual** → Remove slang, add structure
- **Unclear** → Lead with the main point, use bullet points
- **No action** → Add clear next steps

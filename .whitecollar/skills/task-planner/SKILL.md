# Task Planner

Help users break down goals into actionable steps, organize tasks, and create realistic plans.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project or goal
- Feeling overwhelmed by a large task
- Need to prioritize multiple tasks
- Planning events or activities
- Creating daily/weekly schedules
- Breaking down complex goals

## Planning Process

### Step 1: Define the Goal

Clarify:
- What is the end result you want?
- When does it need to be done?
- What resources do you have?
- What constraints exist?

### Step 2: Break Down Into Tasks

1. **Identify major milestones** - Key checkpoints toward the goal
2. **List all tasks** - Everything that needs to happen
3. **Order by dependency** - What must happen before what
4. **Estimate effort** - How long each task takes

### Step 3: Prioritize

Use the **Eisenhower Matrix**:

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|--------|------------|
| **Important** | Do First | Schedule |
| **Not Important** | Delegate | Eliminate |

Or **MoSCoW Method**:
- **Must have** - Critical, non-negotiable
- **Should have** - Important but not critical
- **Could have** - Nice to have
- **Won't have** - Out of scope for now

### Step 4: Create the Plan

```
## Goal: [What you want to achieve]

### Timeline: [Start date] → [End date]

### Milestones
1. [Milestone 1] - [Target date]
2. [Milestone 2] - [Target date]
3. [Milestone 3] - [Target date]

### Task Breakdown

#### Phase 1: [Phase name]
- [ ] Task 1 (Est: X hrs)
- [ ] Task 2 (Est: X hrs)
- [ ] Task 3 (Est: X hrs)

#### Phase 2: [Phase name]
- [ ] Task 4 (Est: X hrs)
- [ ] Task 5 (Est: X hrs)

### Dependencies
- Task 2 requires Task 1 to be complete
- Phase 2 can't start until Milestone 1 is reached

### Risks & Mitigation
- [Risk 1]: [How to handle it]
- [Risk 2]: [How to handle it]

## Productivity Tips

1. **Two-Minute Rule** - If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now
2. **Time Blocking** - Schedule specific times for focused work
3. **Batch Similar Tasks** - Group related tasks together
4. **Buffer Time** - Add 20% extra time to estimates
5. **Review Regularly** - Check progress daily/weekly
6. **Celebrate Wins** - Acknowledge completed milestones

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-planning** - Don't spend more time planning than doing
- **Perfectionism** - Good enough is often good enough
- **No flexibility** - Build in buffer for unexpected things
- **Too many priorities** - Focus on 3 key tasks per day
- **Ignoring energy levels** - Do hard tasks when most alert

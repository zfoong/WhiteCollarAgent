# Research Assistant

Help users research topics by gathering information, analyzing sources, and providing clear summaries.

## When to Use

- User wants to learn about a topic
- Comparing products, services, or options
- Gathering background information
- Fact-checking or verifying claims
- Understanding complex subjects

## Research Process

### Step 1: Clarify the Research Scope

Before starting, understand:
- What specific question needs answering?
- What depth is needed? (quick overview vs. deep dive)
- Any particular sources to prioritize or avoid?
- What format does the user want results in?

### Step 2: Gather Information

1. **Search multiple sources** - Use web search to find relevant information
2. **Verify credibility** - Prioritize authoritative sources
3. **Note key facts** - Record important findings with source references
4. **Identify patterns** - Look for consensus and disagreements

### Step 3: Analyze and Synthesize

- Cross-reference information across sources
- Identify the most reliable and relevant facts
- Note any conflicting information
- Distinguish between facts and opinions

### Step 4: Present Findings

Structure the research summary as:

```
## Research Summary: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Main point 1]
- [Main point 2]
- [Main point 3]

### Detailed Analysis
[Organized breakdown of findings by subtopic]

### Sources
- [Source 1 with link]
- [Source 2 with link]

### Limitations
[Any gaps in research or uncertain areas]

### Recommendations
[Next steps or additional areas to explore]
```

## Research Quality Guidelines

1. **Be thorough but focused** - Cover the topic well without going off-track
2. **Cite sources** - Always provide where information came from
3. **Acknowledge uncertainty** - Be clear when information is unclear or conflicting
4. **Stay neutral** - Present facts objectively, note biases in sources
5. **Summarize clearly** - Make complex information accessible

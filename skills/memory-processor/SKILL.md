# Memory Processor

The only way for agent to save event into long-term memory.

## Files

- `agent_file_system/EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md` - Source (read & clear batches)
- `agent_file_system/MEMORY.md` - Destination (append distilled memories)

## Todo Tracking (REQUIRED)

Use `task_update_todos` to track progress. Create todos at start, update as you go.

**Initial todos (create after reading first batch):**
```
1. [pending] Process and loop for each batch (25~50 lines).
2. [pending] Validate and cleanup
3. [pending] Complete task
```

**After each batch:** Mark current as completed, add next batch if more events exist.

## Batch Processing Workflow

Process 50 lines at a time to avoid memory issues.

### Steps:

1. **Read first batch**: `stream_read` EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md, offset=11, limit=50
2. **Create todos**: Use `task_update_todos` to create initial todo list
3. **Loop for each batch**:
   - Distill batch: Apply rules below, extract IMPORTANT memories only
   - Append memories: `stream_edit` MEMORY.md (append only)
   - Remove batch: `stream_edit` EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md (delete lines 12-61)
   - Update todos: Mark batch completed, add next batch if more events
4. **Validation** (mark todo in_progress):
   - Validate no more unprocessed events in EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md
   - Validate no duplicated memory in MEMORY.md
5. **End task**: `task_end` when validation passes

## Rules

### DISCARD

- Silent background task. NEVER use send_message or interact with user.
- Immediately discard these event types:
  - `[reasoning]`, `[action_start]`, `[gui_action]`, `[screen_description]`
  - `[agent message]` - agent responses are NEVER saved
  - Greetings, small talk, acknowledgments ("hi", "thanks", "ok")
  - Screen descriptions ("The current screen displays...")
  - Truncated text ending in `...`

### SAVE CONDITION

Only save the memory if it contains lasting value:
- User preference or personal fact
- Scheduled event with specific date
- Important decision
- Contact information or deadline

### Format (Strict)

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [category] Full Name predicate object
```

Categories: `[fact]`, `[preference]`, `[event]`, `[decision]`, `[learning]`

### DISTILL, Don't Copy

**Input:**
```
[2026/02/09 06:33:10] [user message]: agent, i am an ai researcher at craftos
```

**Output:**
```
[2026-02-09 06:33:10] [fact] Tham Yik Foong is an AI researcher at CraftOS
```

Note: Get actual names from existing MEMORY.md. Never use "user", "conversation partner", or pronouns.

### No Duplicates

- Check MEMORY.md before saving. Skip if similar memory exists. 
- Actively remove memories you found duplicated in MEMORY.md, keeping only the latest one.

## Allowed Actions

`stream_read`, `stream_edit`, `memory_search`, `grep_files`, `task_end`, `task_update_todos`

## FORBIDDEN Actions

`send_message`, `ignore`, `run_python`, `run_shell`, `write_file`, `create_file`

## Example

**Batch 1 (50 lines):**
- Line 1: DISCARD (greeting)
- Line 2: DISCARD (agent message)
- Line 3: SAVE → `[2026-02-09 06:33:10] [fact] Tham Yik Foong is an AI researcher`
- Line 4: SAVE → `[2026-02-09 06:33:10] [event] Tham Yik Foong has a meeting with John from Company ABC on 15/2/2026, with unknown location`
- Lines 5-50: DISCARD (routine)

**Todo update after batch 1:**
```
1. [completed] Process batch 1 (lines 12-61)
2. [in_progress] Process batch 2 (lines 12-61)
3. [pending] Validate and cleanup
4. [pending] Complete task
```

**Result:** 50 events → 1 memory, progress tracked via todos

[2026/02/17 03:19:02] [task_start]: Created task: 'User Profile Interview'
[2026/02/17 03:19:10] [agent reasoning]: I need to start the user profile interview by sending a warm greeting and asking for their preferred name. This is the first step in the ACKNOWLEDGE phase of the workflow. I should be conversational and friendly, explaining that I want to learn about them to provide better assistance.
[2026/02/17 03:19:10] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Hi there! I'm excited to be your new AI assistant. To help me serve you better, I'd love to learn a bit about you. What would you like me to call you?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:10] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'error': "Execution failed: local variable 'requirements' referenced before assignment"}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:17] [agent reasoning]: The send_message action failed due to an internal error. I need to try again with the same message to start the user profile interview. This is still the ACKNOWLEDGE phase where I'm introducing myself and asking for their preferred name.
[2026/02/17 03:19:17] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Hi there! I'm excited to be your new AI assistant. To help me serve you better, I'd love to learn a bit about you. What would you like me to call you?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:17] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'error': "Execution failed: local variable 'requirements' referenced before assignment"}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:33] [agent reasoning]: The send_message action is failing repeatedly due to an internal error. Since I need to communicate with the user to start the interview, I'll try a simpler approach and just send a basic greeting without the wait_for_user_reply parameter set to true initially.
[2026/02/17 03:19:33] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Hi there! I'm excited to be your new AI assistant. To help me serve you better, I'd love to learn a bit about you. What would you like me to call you?", 'wait_for_user_reply': False}.
[2026/02/17 03:19:33] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'error': "Execution failed: local variable 'requirements' referenced before assignment"}.
[2026/02/17 04:42:00] [task_start]: Created task: 'User Profile Interview'
[2026/02/17 04:42:04] [user message]: agnet, how are you doing?
[2026/02/17 04:42:08] [agent reasoning]: I need to start the user profile interview task. Looking at the current state, I have a new task created for conducting a user profile interview. According to the workflow phases, I should start with the ACKNOWLEDGE phase by sending a warm greeting and asking what they'd like to be called. This is the first step in the interview process to gather information about the user.
[2026/02/17 04:42:08] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Hi there! I'm excited to be your new AI assistant. To help me serve you better, I'd love to learn a bit about you. What would you like me to call you?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:42:22] [agent reasoning]: Great! The user responded with their name - Foong. Now I need to acknowledge their answer and move to the next question in the COLLECT phase. According to the interview flow, after learning their name, I should ask about what they do for work. I'll acknowledge their answer first, then ask about their job/role.
[2026/02/17 04:42:22] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': 'Nice to meet you, Foong! What kind of work do you do?', 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:42:39] [agent reasoning]: Excellent! Foong is an AI researcher who is developing me. This is very relevant information. Now I should acknowledge their answer and continue with the next identity question - asking about their location. This will help me understand their timezone and context better.
[2026/02/17 04:42:39] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "That's fascinating! You're developing me - so you're working on AI research. Where are you based?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:42:54] [agent reasoning]: Great! Foong is based in Fukuoka, Japan. I can infer they're likely in Japan Standard Time (JST/UTC+9). Now I should move to the next phase of questions about communication preferences. I'll acknowledge their location and then ask about their preferred communication style.
[2026/02/17 04:42:54] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Fukuoka - beautiful city! So you're in Japan Standard Time. How would you like me to communicate with you? Do you prefer casual and friendly, or more formal and professional? Brief responses or detailed explanations?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:43:08] [user message]: I live in Fukuoka but I am actually from Malaysia
[2026/02/17 04:43:15] [agent reasoning]: Interesting! Foong is from Malaysia but currently lives in Fukuoka. I should acknowledge this additional information and then continue with the communication preferences question that I asked, since they didn't answer that part yet.
[2026/02/17 04:43:15] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Oh, Malaysian living in Fukuoka - that's a great combination of cultures! So, about communication style - do you prefer casual and friendly, or more formal and professional? Brief responses or detailed explanations?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:43:25] [user message]: friendly is good
[2026/02/17 04:43:31] [agent reasoning]: Perfect! Foong prefers friendly communication. Now I should ask about proactivity level - whether they want me to be proactive with suggestions or wait for their instructions. This is the next important preference to understand for personalizing their experience.
[2026/02/17 04:43:31] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': 'Friendly it is! Should I proactively suggest tasks and reminders, or would you prefer I wait for your instructions?', 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:43:51] [agent reasoning]: Excellent! Foong wants me to be proactive. Now I need to ask about approval requirements - what types of actions they want me to ask approval for before doing. This is the final preference question before wrapping up the interview.
[2026/02/17 04:43:51] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': 'Great! I love being proactive. For which types of actions should I ask your approval first?

[2026/02/17 04:44:08] [user message]: anythign that involve deleting something
[2026/02/17 04:44:15] [agent reasoning]: Perfect! Now I have gathered all the key information from Foong. They want me to ask approval for anything involving deletion. It's time to wrap up the interview by asking if there's anything else they'd like me to know, and then I'll move to the EXECUTE phase to update their profile.
[2026/02/17 04:44:15] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "Got it - I'll always ask before deleting anything. Is there anything else you'd like me to know about you or how you prefer to work?", 'wait_for_user_reply': True}.

[2026/02/17 04:46:31] [agent reasoning]: Great! Foong has indicated that's all the information they want to share. Now I need to move to the EXECUTE phase. I should read the current USER.md file first to understand the existing format, then update it with all the information I've gathered: name (Foong), job (AI researcher), location (Fukuoka, originally from Malaysia), timezone (Japan Standard Time), communication preferences (friendly), proactivity level (high), and approval requirements (deletion actions).

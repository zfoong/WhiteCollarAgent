[2026/02/09 03:46:15] [task_start]: Created task: 'Find cheapest flight Fukuoka to Tokyo'
[2026/02/09 03:46:23] [agent reasoning]: The task has just started and I need to acknowledge receipt of the task to the user. The task is to find the cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on 13/feb/2026 using flight booking websites, and I need to switch to GUI mode first. This is the ACKNOWLEDGE phase where I should confirm understanding with the user.

[2026/02/09 03:46:23] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'status': 'ok', 'fire_at_delay': 0, 'wait_for_user_reply': False}.
[2026/02/09 03:46:30] [agent reasoning]: Now I need to switch to GUI mode as specified in the task instruction. The user wants me to use flight booking websites, which requires GUI mode for web browsing and interaction. After switching to GUI mode, I'll need to set up the todo list to track progress through the workflow phases.
[2026/02/09 03:46:30] [action_start]: Running action set_mode with input: {'target_mode': 'gui'}.
[2026/02/09 03:46:30] [action_end]: Action set_mode completed with output: {'status': 'ok', 'gui_mode': True, 'message': 'Successfully switched to GUI mode.'}.
[2026/02/09 03:47:21] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a dark blue GUI desktop with two icons on the left: a 'File System' disk icon and a 'Home' folder icon. At the top left corner, there is an 'Applications' button, and the top right corner shows a system tray with the date '2025-04-09', time '03:46', and a sound icon. Reviewing the event stream, the agent has successfully completed the ACKNOWLEDGE phase by sending a task receipt message to the user and switching to GUI mode as required. The acknowledgment message has been delivered, and the GUI mode is active, so the ACKNOWLEDGE step is fully completed. The system should now proceed to the next phase of the task workflow. | step complete, move to next step | The element involved has a position of [ymin_px, xmin_px, ymax_px, xmax_px] = "No UI element needed for action"

[2026/02/09 03:48:42] [agent reasoning]: The current screen shows a dark blue desktop with two vertically aligned icons on the left: a top 'File System' disk icon and a bottom 'Home' folder icon. The top left corner has an 'Applications' button, and the top right corner contains a system tray displaying the date '2025-04-09', time '03:47', a sound icon, and the text 'abc'. Reviewing the event stream, the ACKNOWLEDGE phase has been marked as completed, and the current in-progress todo is 'PLAN: Set up todo list for flight search workflow'. Per the task's mandatory lifecycle, this PLAN step requires defining a structured todo list with phase-prefixed items (Collect, Execute, Verify, Confirm, Cleanup) that align with the workflow standards. The Collect phase needs to formalize checks for missing flight search details, the Execute phase needs atomic browsing steps, and subsequent phases need clear verification and confirmation steps. The next logical step is to replace the generic PLAN todo with these structured phase-specific todos to ensure the task progresses per the defined workflow. | Update todo list to replace the generic PLAN todo with structured phase-prefixed todos (Collect, Execute, Verify, Confirm, Cleanup) for the flight search task and mark the PLAN todo as completed | The element involved has a position of [ymin_px, xmin_px, ymax_px, xmax_px] = "No UI element needed for action"

Reviewing the event stream, the ACKNOWLEDGE and PLAN phases of the task have been successfully marked as completed, with the next pending todo being 'COLLECT: Check for any missing flight search details (dates, passenger count, preferences)'. The task specifies a flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on 13/feb/2026 but lacks critical information needed for execution: the number of passengers (broken down by adults, children, and infants), travel class preference (e.g., economy, business), any specific airline preferences, and baggage allowance requirements. To adhere to the task workflow, the COLLECT phase must be initiated by gathering this missing information from the user, so the COLLECT todo should be marked as in_progress and the user should be asked these clarifying questions. | Initiate COLLECT phase by asking user for missing flight search details: number of passengers (adults/children/infants), travel class preference, specific airline preferences (if any), and baggage allowance requirements (if any) | The element involved has a position of [ymin_px, xmin_px, ymax_px, xmax_px] = "No UI element needed for action"

[2026/02/09 03:54:17] [agent reasoning]: The user has responded with the passenger information - 1 passenger - and asked me to decide the rest myself. This means I have the key information needed to proceed. I should mark the COLLECT phase as completed and move to the EXECUTE phase. Since the user wants me to decide the remaining details (travel class, airline preferences, baggage), I'll use reasonable defaults: economy class, no specific airline restrictions, and standard baggage allowance. Now I need to update the todos to mark COLLECT as completed and start the EXECUTE phase by opening a web browser to begin searching for flights.

The current todo shows 'EXECUTE: Open web browser and navigate to flight booking website' is in_progress. I need to actually perform this action - open a web browser and navigate to a flight booking website. Since I'm in GUI mode, I should use a GUI action to open a browser and navigate to a flight booking site like Google Flights or Expedia.

This suggests the files are very large. Let me try a different approach - I'll use grep_files to search for specific patterns in the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file to see what actual events are available, focusing on user messages and other relevant event types that might contain information worth saving to memory.

[2026/02/09 08:40:35] [agent reasoning]: I can see from the event stream that I've been trying to read the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file but the outputs keep getting saved to temporary files, which suggests the file is very large. I need to take a different approach. Let me use grep_files to search for specific patterns that would indicate actual user messages or events worth processing, rather than trying to read the entire file. I'll search for patterns that might contain valuable information like user messages with actual content.

[2026/02/09 08:40:46] [agent reasoning]: I can see from the event stream that there are many events in the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file (870 matching chunks found). I can see from the grep results that there are user messages starting around line 277-286, including a greeting "agent, how are you?" which should be discarded according to the rules. I need to start processing the batch from offset=11 (after header) with limit=50 as per the workflow. Let me try to read the actual file content by using a more targeted approach - I'll read a smaller chunk to see the actual events.

I can see from the grep results that there are 870 matching chunks and the file has 38 total lines. The last stream_read attempt at offset 275 returned 0 lines, suggesting I've reached the end or the offset is incorrect.

I can see the actual events that need processing: lines 12-21 contain routine events like task_end, action_end, task_start, action_start, and write_file entries. According to the memory processing rules, these should all be discarded as they are routine task lifecycle events, agent actions, or system events. I need to continue reading the next batch to find events that might contain valuable information worth saving to memory. Let me read the next 5 lines to continue the batch processing.

According to the memory processing rules, none of these events contain valuable information worth saving to memory.

[2026/02/09 08:47:24] [agent reasoning]: I can see from the event stream that I've been stuck in a loop trying to process the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file. The outputs keep getting saved to temporary files due to the file being very large, and I'm having persistent issues with stream_edit exact matching. From my last successful stream_read attempts, I can see that the file contains mostly routine events that should be discarded according to the memory processing rules (agent messages, acknowledgments, task lifecycle events). Since I'm having trouble with the exact string matching for stream_edit operations and the file appears to contain mostly routine events that should be discarded, I need to check if there are actually any events worth processing. Let me try a final approach to see what's currently in the file and determine if there are any valuable events left, or if I should end the task.

The outputs keep getting saved to temporary files due to the file being very large, and I'm having persistent issues with stream_edit exact matching. From my last successful stream_read, I can see that lines 13-15 contain routine events that should be discarded according to the memory processing rules: line 13 is an agent message (discard), line 14 is a user acknowledgment (discard), and line 15 is a task_start event (discard). Since none of these contain valuable information and I'm having technical difficulties with the stream_edit operations, I should check if there are actually any events worth processing by doing a final check, or end the task if no valuable events remain.

Since I'm having technical difficulties with stream_edit operations and the remaining events appear to be routine events that should be discarded, I should check if there are actually any valuable events left by doing a final check with a very small read to see the current state of the file.

The key event to potentially save is line 13 where the user asks about April plans - this shows the user is interested in their schedule/plans. I need to check MEMORY.md first to see if there's existing information about the user's name, then apply the filtering rules to distill and save valuable memories.

[2026/02/09 11:29:09] [agent reasoning]: I can see the MEMORY.md file already contains information about Tham Yik Foong's April plans and preferences. Looking at the batch I need to process (lines 12-22 from EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md), I can see that line 13 shows the user asking about April plans. However, I notice that lines 17-20 in MEMORY.md already contain similar information about April plans. I need to check if this is a duplicate. The event from line 13 in the unprocessed events shows the user asking about April plans on 2026/02/09 09:46:20, and I can see that MEMORY.md already has entries from the same timestamp about April plans. This appears to be a duplicate, so I should not save it again. Let me process this batch and remove the duplicate entries.

Let me fix this and remove the processed batch from EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md. Since the information about April plans is already in MEMORY.md (lines 17-20), I don't need to add it again.

Since this is a silent background task and I can't interact with the user, I need to be more careful about the exact text matching.

[2026/02/09 15:15:15] [agent reasoning]: I can see there are events to process in the first batch. I need to create initial todos to track progress and then start processing these events. According to the rules, I should discard agent messages, greetings, and routine interactions, but save important information like user preferences, events, and facts. Let me create the initial todo list first.

- Line 23: User asking about weather in Fukuoka - this is routine, discard
- Line 24: Task start - discard (task metadata)
- Lines 25-33: Agent message about weather - discard (agent messages are never saved)
- Line 34: Task end - discard (task metadata)
- Line 35: User mentions they live in Fukuoka - this is a fact about the user, should save
- Line 36: Agent response - discard (agent message)
- Line 37: User asking about April plans - routine question, discard
- Line 38: Task start - discard (task metadata)
- Line 39: Agent message - discard (agent message)
- Line 40: Task end - discard (task metadata)
- Line 41: User provides specific travel dates (April 20-23) - this is an important event, should save
- Line 42: Agent response - discard (agent message)
- Line 43: User response "nahh" - routine, discard

I need to check MEMORY.md first to see if there's existing information about the user, then save the important facts.

The 'Flights' tab is selected, and a 'Sponsored results' section is visible with listings from four platforms: Trip.com, Skyscanner.jp, Agoda.com, and Traveloka. Key details include Skyscanner.jp’s listing showing a price of ¥7490 for a return flight, while other platforms highlight general deals without specific immediate price values. Browser controls (search bar with full query, Sign in, Settings) are present at the top. Reviewing the event stream, the agent successfully updated the todos to set 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms' as in_progress, and the search results page provides the necessary starting point for price comparison. This validates that the execution phase’s todo is actively underway. The first atomic, verifiable step to advance price comparison is to access detailed flight price information from one of the listed platforms; Skyscanner.jp is prioritized here due to its visible specific price, which requires further verification of terms (e.g., one-way vs return, hidden fees). No missing information is identified (user specified no questions), so proceeding with this step is appropriate. | Click on the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result listing to view detailed flight price information and associated terms The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [130, 5, 191, 23]

The top taskbar shows open windows including a Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search', but the browser window is not active (the desktop is visible instead of the browser's search results page). Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action intended to access the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result was executed at (160, 14), which likely targeted a non-interactive area outside the browser's search results or on the taskbar, failing to load the Skyscanner page. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of the failed action is the inactive browser window. To proceed with price comparison, the first atomic step is to activate the Chromium browser window by clicking its taskbar tab, ensuring the search results page with the Skyscanner.jp listing becomes accessible for subsequent interactions. | Click on the Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search' in the taskbar to activate the browser window and access the flight search results page The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [450, 2, 510, 15]

Two icons are present on the left: a 'File System' icon at the top and a yellow-bordered 'Home' folder icon below it. The top taskbar shows an open Chromium browser tab labeled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search [Chromium]'. Reviewing the event stream, the previous window_control action to focus the Chromium tab failed due to a PyGetWindow incompatibility with Linux. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of the stalled progress is the inability to activate the browser window via the previous method. An alternative atomic, verifiable step is required to access the flight search results. A mouse click on the visible Chromium taskbar tab is a viable alternative to activate the browser window, which will allow continuation of the price comparison process.

[2026/02/09 15:56:17] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Linux desktop with a dark background. Two icons are positioned on the left: a 'File System' icon at the top and a yellow-bordered 'Home' folder icon below it. The top taskbar includes multiple open tabs/windows: a tab labeled 'Applications', a Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search [Chromium]', and a tab with '2026-02-09 abc' paired with a digital clock showing 15:55. A small calendar pop-up near the top center displays February 2026, with the 17th (the target travel date) highlighted. Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action on the Chromium taskbar tab completed with a 'success' status, but the screen confirms the Chromium browser window was not activated (the desktop and calendar pop-up remain visible instead of the flight search results page). This validates that the previous action failed to achieve its intended goal of accessing the flight search results for price comparison. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of stalled progress is the inability to bring the Chromium window to the foreground. Since the user specified no questions should be asked, an alternative atomic, verifiable step is to re-perform a single left click on the visible Chromium taskbar tab—this action is viable as it directly targets the browser tab to activate the window, allowing continuation of the price comparison process. | Single left click on the Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search [Chromium]' in the taskbar to activate the browser window The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [130, 4, 227, 22]

The 'Flights' tab is selected, and a 'Sponsored results' section includes listings from four platforms: Trip.com (mentions ¥69,000+ routes without specific immediate prices), Skyscanner.jp (clearly lists a ¥7490 return flight with 'no hidden fees'), Agoda.com (highlights general deals and a first-booking discount), and Traveloka (offers up to 10% off). Reviewing the event stream, the two consecutive mouse click actions on the Chromium taskbar tab—initially aimed at resolving the prior window activation failure due to PyGetWindow incompatibility—ultimately succeeded in bringing the browser window to the foreground, resolving the stall in progress for the 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms' todo. The in-progress todo’s advancement requires an atomic, verifiable step to gather detailed price context; Skyscanner.jp is prioritized due to its specific stated price. The done criteria for this step is to access Skyscanner.jp’s detailed flight information to verify if the ¥7490 price applies to the 17/feb/2026 travel date and check for unstated terms (e.g., baggage allowances). No missing information is identified (user specified no questions), so this action is appropriate. | Single left click on the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result listing to view detailed flight price information and verify its applicability to the 17/feb/2026 travel date The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [87, 688, 153, 704]

The 'Flights' tab is selected at the top of the search results section. Below the search bar, a 'Sponsored results' section lists four flight booking platforms: Trip.com (mentions ¥69,000+ routes without specific immediate prices), Skyscanner.jp (clearly displays a ¥7490 return flight with the note 'no hidden fees'), Agoda.com (highlights general deals and a first-booking discount), and Traveloka (offers up to 10% off). Each platform’s listing includes a URL, a brief description, and a rating. Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action on the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result completed with a 'success' status, but the screen confirms that navigation to Skyscanner.jp’s detailed flight price page did not occur (the Google search results page remains fully visible). This validates that the previous action failed to achieve its intended goal of accessing detailed price information to verify the ¥7490 flight’s applicability to the 17/feb/2026 travel date. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of stalled progress is the untriggered navigation to Skyscanner.jp’s site.

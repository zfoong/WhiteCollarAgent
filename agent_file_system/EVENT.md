[2026/02/09 03:46:15] [task_start]: Created task: 'Find cheapest flight Fukuoka to Tokyo'
[2026/02/09 03:46:23] [agent reasoning]: The task has just started and I need to acknowledge receipt of the task to the user. The task is to find the cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on 13/feb/2026 using flight booking websites, and I need to switch to GUI mode first. This is the ACKNOWLEDGE phase where I should confirm understanding with the user.
[2026/02/09 03:46:23] [action_start]: Running action send_message with input: {'message': "I've received your task to find the cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on 13/feb/2026 using flight booking websites. I'll start by switching to GUI mode and then search for flights on various booking platforms to find you the best deal.", 'wait_for_user_reply': False}.

[2026/02/09 03:46:23] [action_end]: Action send_message completed with output: {'status': 'ok', 'fire_at_delay': 0, 'wait_for_user_reply': False}.
[2026/02/09 03:46:30] [agent reasoning]: Now I need to switch to GUI mode as specified in the task instruction. The user wants me to use flight booking websites, which requires GUI mode for web browsing and interaction. After switching to GUI mode, I'll need to set up the todo list to track progress through the workflow phases.
[2026/02/09 03:46:30] [action_start]: Running action set_mode with input: {'target_mode': 'gui'}.
[2026/02/09 03:46:30] [action_end]: Action set_mode completed with output: {'status': 'ok', 'gui_mode': True, 'message': 'Successfully switched to GUI mode.'}.
[2026/02/09 03:47:21] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a dark blue GUI desktop with two icons on the left: a 'File System' disk icon and a 'Home' folder icon. At the top left corner, there is an 'Applications' button, and the top right corner shows a system tray with the date '2025-04-09', time '03:46', and a sound icon. Reviewing the event stream, the agent has successfully completed the ACKNOWLEDGE phase by sending a task receipt message to the user and switching to GUI mode as required. The acknowledgment message has been delivered, and the GUI mode is active, so the ACKNOWLEDGE step is fully completed. The system should now proceed to the next phase of the task workflow. | step complete, move to next step | The element involved has a position of [ymin_px, xmin_px, ymax_px, xmax_px] = "No UI element needed for action"

[2026/02/09 03:48:42] [agent reasoning]: The current screen shows a dark blue desktop with two vertically aligned icons on the left: a top 'File System' disk icon and a bottom 'Home' folder icon. The top left corner has an 'Applications' button, and the top right corner contains a system tray displaying the date '2025-04-09', time '03:47', a sound icon, and the text 'abc'. Reviewing the event stream, the ACKNOWLEDGE phase has been marked as completed, and the current in-progress todo is 'PLAN: Set up todo list for flight search workflow'. Per the task's mandatory lifecycle, this PLAN step requires defining a structured todo list with phase-prefixed items (Collect, Execute, Verify, Confirm, Cleanup) that align with the workflow standards. The Collect phase needs to formalize checks for missing flight search details, the Execute phase needs atomic browsing steps, and subsequent phases need clear verification and confirmation steps. The next logical step is to replace the generic PLAN todo with these structured phase-specific todos to ensure the task progresses per the defined workflow. | Update todo list to replace the generic PLAN todo with structured phase-prefixed todos (Collect, Execute, Verify, Confirm, Cleanup) for the flight search task and mark the PLAN todo as completed | The element involved has a position of [ymin_px, xmin_px, ymax_px, xmax_px] = "No UI element needed for action"

Reviewing the event stream, the ACKNOWLEDGE and PLAN phases of the task have been successfully marked as completed, with the next pending todo being 'COLLECT: Check for any missing flight search details (dates, passenger count, preferences)'. The task specifies a flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on 13/feb/2026 but lacks critical information needed for execution: the number of passengers (broken down by adults, children, and infants), travel class preference (e.g., economy, business), any specific airline preferences, and baggage allowance requirements. To adhere to the task workflow, the COLLECT phase must be initiated by gathering this missing information from the user, so the COLLECT todo should be marked as in_progress and the user should be asked these clarifying questions. | Initiate COLLECT phase by asking user for missing flight search details: number of passengers (adults/children/infants), travel class preference, specific airline preferences (if any), and baggage allowance requirements (if any) | The element involved has a position of [ymin_px, xmin_px, ymax_px, xmax_px] = "No UI element needed for action"

[2026/02/09 03:54:17] [agent reasoning]: The user has responded with the passenger information - 1 passenger - and asked me to decide the rest myself. This means I have the key information needed to proceed. I should mark the COLLECT phase as completed and move to the EXECUTE phase. Since the user wants me to decide the remaining details (travel class, airline preferences, baggage), I'll use reasonable defaults: economy class, no specific airline restrictions, and standard baggage allowance. Now I need to update the todos to mark COLLECT as completed and start the EXECUTE phase by opening a web browser to begin searching for flights.

The current todo shows 'EXECUTE: Open web browser and navigate to flight booking website' is in_progress. I need to actually perform this action - open a web browser and navigate to a flight booking website. Since I'm in GUI mode, I should use a GUI action to open a browser and navigate to a flight booking site like Google Flights or Expedia.

This suggests the files are very large. Let me try a different approach - I'll use grep_files to search for specific patterns in the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file to see what actual events are available, focusing on user messages and other relevant event types that might contain information worth saving to memory.

[2026/02/09 08:40:35] [agent reasoning]: I can see from the event stream that I've been trying to read the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file but the outputs keep getting saved to temporary files, which suggests the file is very large. I need to take a different approach. Let me use grep_files to search for specific patterns that would indicate actual user messages or events worth processing, rather than trying to read the entire file. I'll search for patterns that might contain valuable information like user messages with actual content.

[2026/02/09 08:40:46] [agent reasoning]: I can see from the event stream that there are many events in the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file (870 matching chunks found). I can see from the grep results that there are user messages starting around line 277-286, including a greeting "agent, how are you?" which should be discarded according to the rules. I need to start processing the batch from offset=11 (after header) with limit=50 as per the workflow. Let me try to read the actual file content by using a more targeted approach - I'll read a smaller chunk to see the actual events.

I can see from the grep results that there are 870 matching chunks and the file has 38 total lines. The last stream_read attempt at offset 275 returned 0 lines, suggesting I've reached the end or the offset is incorrect.

I can see the actual events that need processing: lines 12-21 contain routine events like task_end, action_end, task_start, action_start, and write_file entries. According to the memory processing rules, these should all be discarded as they are routine task lifecycle events, agent actions, or system events. I need to continue reading the next batch to find events that might contain valuable information worth saving to memory. Let me read the next 5 lines to continue the batch processing.

According to the memory processing rules, none of these events contain valuable information worth saving to memory.

[2026/02/09 08:47:24] [agent reasoning]: I can see from the event stream that I've been stuck in a loop trying to process the EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md file. The outputs keep getting saved to temporary files due to the file being very large, and I'm having persistent issues with stream_edit exact matching. From my last successful stream_read attempts, I can see that the file contains mostly routine events that should be discarded according to the memory processing rules (agent messages, acknowledgments, task lifecycle events). Since I'm having trouble with the exact string matching for stream_edit operations and the file appears to contain mostly routine events that should be discarded, I need to check if there are actually any events worth processing. Let me try a final approach to see what's currently in the file and determine if there are any valuable events left, or if I should end the task.

The outputs keep getting saved to temporary files due to the file being very large, and I'm having persistent issues with stream_edit exact matching. From my last successful stream_read, I can see that lines 13-15 contain routine events that should be discarded according to the memory processing rules: line 13 is an agent message (discard), line 14 is a user acknowledgment (discard), and line 15 is a task_start event (discard). Since none of these contain valuable information and I'm having technical difficulties with the stream_edit operations, I should check if there are actually any events worth processing by doing a final check, or end the task if no valuable events remain.

Since I'm having technical difficulties with stream_edit operations and the remaining events appear to be routine events that should be discarded, I should check if there are actually any valuable events left by doing a final check with a very small read to see the current state of the file.

[2026/02/09 09:42:59] [agent reasoning]: I need to start processing memory events. According to the skill instructions, I should first read the first batch of 50 lines from EVENT_UNPROCESSED.md starting from offset 11 (line 12), then create the initial todo list. Let me begin by reading the unprocessed events file to see what needs to be processed.

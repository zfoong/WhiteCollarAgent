[2026/02/09 15:49:26] [agent reasoning]: The acknowledge phase is now complete. I need to update the first todo as completed and move to the collect phase. The next step is to switch to GUI mode as requested in the task instruction, which will enable screen interaction capabilities for flight searching.

[2026/02/09 15:49:35] [agent reasoning]: Now I need to switch to GUI mode as requested in the task instruction. This will enable screen interaction capabilities needed for searching flights on booking websites. The current mode is CLI, so I need to switch to GUI mode.
[2026/02/09 15:50:09] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays multiple open Thunar file manager windows, all showing the 'config' directory with folders Desktop, Downloads, and ssl, confirming GUI mode is active. Reviewing the event stream, the agent successfully completed the Acknowledge phase, updated the todos to set the Collect phase's 'Switch to GUI mode for flight search' as in_progress, and executed the set_mode action which returned a success message indicating GUI mode was enabled. This verifies that the Collect phase's todo has been fully completed. The next logical step is to move to the subsequent todo in the workflow. | step complete, move to next step The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [258, 635, 341, 720]

[2026/02/09 15:50:57] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Chromium browser's new tab page in GUI mode. Key elements include the Google logo centered at the top, a prominent search bar labeled 'Search Google or type a URL' below the logo, and four shortcut icons (Travel Deals, Google Translate, Web Store, Add shortcut) beneath the search bar. Browser controls (new tab, bookmarks, Gmail, Images) are visible in the top right corner. Reviewing the event stream, the agent has successfully completed the Acknowledge and Collect phases (switched to GUI mode), updated the todos to set the 'Execute: Search for flights on booking websites' todo as in_progress. The GUI environment is fully operational, and the browser is ready for flight search activities. The next logical step is to activate the Google search bar to input a query for flights from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17, 2026, as this is the first atomic step in executing the flight search todo. | Activate the Google search bar to input a query for the cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17, 2026 The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [173, 444, 200, 476]
[2026/02/09 15:51:39] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Chromium browser's new tab page in GUI mode. Key elements include a Google logo centered at the top, an active Google search bar labeled 'Search Google or type a URL' (evidenced by the visible dropdown list of search suggestions below it), browser controls (new tab, bookmarks, Gmail, Images) in the top right corner, and a 'Customize Chromium' button at the bottom right. The search suggestions dropdown includes options related to flight searches from Fukuoka to Tokyo and other unrelated queries. Reviewing the event stream, the previous left mouse click action on the search bar completed successfully with a 'success' status, and the active search bar confirms this action achieved its intended goal of activating the search bar for input. The current in-progress todo is 'Execute: Search for flights on booking websites', so the next atomic step to advance this todo is to input the specific query for the cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17, 2026 into the active search bar to initiate the flight search process. | Type 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17, 2026' into the active Google search bar The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [0, 1, 20, 23]
[2026/02/09 15:52:21] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Chromium browser's new tab page in active GUI mode. Key details include: a centered Google logo at the top; an active search bar with the fully entered query 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026'; a dropdown list of search suggestions beneath the search bar where the top suggestion exactly matches the entered query; additional related suggestions (e.g., 'fukuoka to tokyo flight price') and unrelated suggestions (e.g., 'fukuoka to manila') in the dropdown; and browser controls (Gmail, Images, app grid, All Bookmarks) in the top right corner. Reviewing the event stream, the previous keyboard_type action to input the search query completed with a success status, and the screen confirms the query is fully entered in the active search bar—verifying the action worked as intended. The current in-progress todo is 'Execute: Search for flights on booking websites'. To advance this todo, the next atomic, verifiable step is to initiate the search for the specified flight information by interacting with the top search suggestion that matches the query exactly, as this will trigger the Google search for the required flight details. | Click on the top search suggestion matching the query 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026' to initiate the Google search The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [450, 2, 510, 15]
[2026/02/09 15:53:01] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Chromium browser's Google search results page in GUI mode, loaded with the query 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026'. Key elements include the Google logo at the top, the active search bar with the full query, a selected 'Flights' tab among navigation options, and a list of sponsored flight results from platforms like Trip.com, Skyscanner.jp, Agoda.com, and Traveloka—each advertising flight deals from Fukuoka to Tokyo. Reviewing the event stream, the previous 'enter' hotkey action completed successfully, which triggered the loading of this search results page. This confirms that the in-progress todo 'Execute: Search for flights on booking websites' has been fully completed, as the done criteria (accessing relevant flight search results to proceed with price comparison) has been met. The next logical step is to mark this todo as completed and move to the subsequent todo in the workflow. | step complete, move to next step The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [481, 713, 609, 731]
[2026/02/09 15:53:12] [todos]:

[2026/02/09 15:53:40] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Chromium browser's Google search results page in GUI mode, loaded with the query 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026'. The 'Flights' tab is selected, and a 'Sponsored results' section is visible with listings from four platforms: Trip.com, Skyscanner.jp, Agoda.com, and Traveloka. Key details include Skyscanner.jp’s listing showing a price of ¥7490 for a return flight, while other platforms highlight general deals without specific immediate price values. Browser controls (search bar with full query, Sign in, Settings) are present at the top. Reviewing the event stream, the agent successfully updated the todos to set 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms' as in_progress, and the search results page provides the necessary starting point for price comparison. This validates that the execution phase’s todo is actively underway. The first atomic, verifiable step to advance price comparison is to access detailed flight price information from one of the listed platforms; Skyscanner.jp is prioritized here due to its visible specific price, which requires further verification of terms (e.g., one-way vs return, hidden fees). No missing information is identified (user specified no questions), so proceeding with this step is appropriate. | Click on the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result listing to view detailed flight price information and associated terms The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [130, 5, 191, 23]
[2026/02/09 15:54:17] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a desktop with a dark background, featuring a yellow-bordered 'Home' folder icon on the left and a 'File System' icon above it. The top taskbar shows open windows including a Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search', but the browser window is not active (the desktop is visible instead of the browser's search results page). Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action intended to access the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result was executed at (160, 14), which likely targeted a non-interactive area outside the browser's search results or on the taskbar, failing to load the Skyscanner page. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of the failed action is the inactive browser window. To proceed with price comparison, the first atomic step is to activate the Chromium browser window by clicking its taskbar tab, ensuring the search results page with the Skyscanner.jp listing becomes accessible for subsequent interactions. | Click on the Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search' in the taskbar to activate the browser window and access the flight search results page The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [450, 2, 510, 15]
[2026/02/09 15:55:07] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Linux desktop with a dark background. Two icons are present on the left: a 'File System' icon at the top and a yellow-bordered 'Home' folder icon below it. The top taskbar shows an open Chromium browser tab labeled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search [Chromium]'. Reviewing the event stream, the previous window_control action to focus the Chromium tab failed due to a PyGetWindow incompatibility with Linux. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of the stalled progress is the inability to activate the browser window via the previous method. An alternative atomic, verifiable step is required to access the flight search results. A mouse click on the visible Chromium taskbar tab is a viable alternative to activate the browser window, which will allow continuation of the price comparison process. No missing information is identified (user specified no questions), so this alternative action is appropriate. | Click on the Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search [Chromium]' in the taskbar to activate the browser window The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [450, 2, 510, 15]
[2026/02/09 15:56:17] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays a Linux desktop with a dark background. Two icons are positioned on the left: a 'File System' icon at the top and a yellow-bordered 'Home' folder icon below it. The top taskbar includes multiple open tabs/windows: a tab labeled 'Applications', a Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search [Chromium]', and a tab with '2026-02-09 abc' paired with a digital clock showing 15:55. A small calendar pop-up near the top center displays February 2026, with the 17th (the target travel date) highlighted. Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action on the Chromium taskbar tab completed with a 'success' status, but the screen confirms the Chromium browser window was not activated (the desktop and calendar pop-up remain visible instead of the flight search results page). This validates that the previous action failed to achieve its intended goal of accessing the flight search results for price comparison. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of stalled progress is the inability to bring the Chromium window to the foreground. Since the user specified no questions should be asked, an alternative atomic, verifiable step is to re-perform a single left click on the visible Chromium taskbar tab—this action is viable as it directly targets the browser tab to activate the window, allowing continuation of the price comparison process. | Single left click on the Chromium browser tab titled 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026 - Google Search [Chromium]' in the taskbar to activate the browser window The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [130, 4, 227, 22]
[2026/02/09 15:57:10] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays an activated Chromium browser window showing Google search results for the query 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026'. The 'Flights' tab is selected, and a 'Sponsored results' section includes listings from four platforms: Trip.com (mentions ¥69,000+ routes without specific immediate prices), Skyscanner.jp (clearly lists a ¥7490 return flight with 'no hidden fees'), Agoda.com (highlights general deals and a first-booking discount), and Traveloka (offers up to 10% off). Reviewing the event stream, the two consecutive mouse click actions on the Chromium taskbar tab—initially aimed at resolving the prior window activation failure due to PyGetWindow incompatibility—ultimately succeeded in bringing the browser window to the foreground, resolving the stall in progress for the 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms' todo. The in-progress todo’s advancement requires an atomic, verifiable step to gather detailed price context; Skyscanner.jp is prioritized due to its specific stated price. The done criteria for this step is to access Skyscanner.jp’s detailed flight information to verify if the ¥7490 price applies to the 17/feb/2026 travel date and check for unstated terms (e.g., baggage allowances). No missing information is identified (user specified no questions), so this action is appropriate. | Single left click on the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result listing to view detailed flight price information and verify its applicability to the 17/feb/2026 travel date The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [87, 688, 153, 704]
[2026/02/09 15:58:07] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays an activated Chromium browser window showing Google search results for the query 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026'. The 'Flights' tab is selected at the top of the search results section. Below the search bar, a 'Sponsored results' section lists four flight booking platforms: Trip.com (mentions ¥69,000+ routes without specific immediate prices), Skyscanner.jp (clearly displays a ¥7490 return flight with the note 'no hidden fees'), Agoda.com (highlights general deals and a first-booking discount), and Traveloka (offers up to 10% off). Each platform’s listing includes a URL, a brief description, and a rating. Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action on the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result completed with a 'success' status, but the screen confirms that navigation to Skyscanner.jp’s detailed flight price page did not occur (the Google search results page remains fully visible). This validates that the previous action failed to achieve its intended goal of accessing detailed price information to verify the ¥7490 flight’s applicability to the 17/feb/2026 travel date. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of stalled progress is the untriggered navigation to Skyscanner.jp’s site. Since the user specified no questions should be asked, an atomic, verifiable alternative step is to re-perform a single left click on the interactive link within the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result to initiate navigation and access the required detailed price and term information. | Single left click on the interactive link within the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result listing to navigate to its detailed flight price information page The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [124, 763, 204, 781]
[2026/02/09 15:58:53] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays an activated Chromium browser window open to an Agoda.com flights page (URL: agoda.com/flights?id=1834241...). Key UI elements include a 'Bundle and save! Flight + Hotel' banner, 'Hotels & Homes' and 'Transport' dropdowns, 'Sign in' and 'Create account' buttons, a hamburger menu, and browser navigation controls (back, forward, refresh) at the top left. The main content area of the Agoda page is blank. Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click intended for the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result's interactive link completed with a 'success' status but incorrectly navigated to the Agoda page instead of Skyscanner's detailed price page—this confirms the action failed to achieve its intended goal of accessing Skyscanner's flight price information for comparison. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of the misnavigation is likely an accidental target of the wrong sponsored result element. Since the user specified no questions should be asked, the atomic, verifiable next step is to click the browser's back button to return to the Google flight search results page, where the correct Skyscanner.jp link can be re-targeted to continue price comparison. | Single left click on the browser's back button to return to the Google flight search results page for 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026' The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [56, 99, 86, 128]
[2026/02/09 15:59:41] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays an activated Chromium browser window open to Agoda.com's flights page. Key UI elements include the Agoda logo at the top left, the 'Flights' tab selected, the 'One-way' option chosen, empty input fields for 'Flying from', 'Flying to', 'Departure', and '1 Passenger, Economy', a blue 'SEARCH FLIGHTS' button, a 'Bundle and Save' banner, a QR code pop-up offering 10% off the first app booking, and browser navigation controls (back, forward, refresh) at the top left. Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action on the browser's back button completed with a 'success' status but failed to navigate back to the Google flight search results page—confirming the action did not achieve its intended goal of returning to the page with Skyscanner.jp's sponsored result for price comparison. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of stalled progress is the uncompleted navigation back to the Google search results. Since the user specified no questions should be asked, the atomic, verifiable next step is to re-perform a single left click on the browser's back button to attempt returning to the Google flight search results page, where the correct Skyscanner.jp link can be re-targeted to continue price comparison. | Single left click on the browser's back button to attempt returning to the Google flight search results page for 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026' The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [977, 96, 1006, 132]
[2026/02/09 16:00:35] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays an activated Chromium browser window open to Agoda.com's Flights page. Key UI elements include the Agoda logo at the top left, the 'Flights' tab selected, the 'One-way' option chosen, empty input fields for 'Flying from', 'Flying to', 'Departure', and '1 Passenger, Economy', a blue 'SEARCH FLIGHTS' button, a 'Bundle and Save' banner, a QR code pop-up offering 10% off the first app booking, and browser navigation controls (back, forward, refresh) at the top left. A Chromium profile menu is open on the right, showing options like 'Sign in to Chromium' and 'Passwords and autofill'. Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action intended for the browser's back button was targeted at (991, 114), which instead activated the Chromium profile menu—confirming the action failed to navigate back to the Google flight search results page. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of stalled progress is mis-targeting the wrong UI element (profile icon instead of the actual back button). Since the user specified no questions should be asked, the atomic, verifiable next step is to perform a single left click on the correct browser back button (the left-pointing arrow at the top left of the browser window) to attempt returning to the Google flight search results page, where the Skyscanner.jp sponsored result can be re-targeted to continue price comparison. | Single left click on the browser's top-left back button (left-pointing arrow) to attempt returning to the Google flight search results page for 'cheapest flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo on February 17 2026' The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [19, 7, 97, 22]
[2026/02/09 16:01:19] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays an activated Chromium browser window open to Agoda.com's Flights page (GUI mode active). Key details include: an open Xfce Applications menu on the left (showing options like Run Program, Terminal Emulator, File Manager); the Agoda page with empty flight input fields (Flying from, Flying to, Departure), a selected One-way option, a blue SEARCH FLIGHTS button, and a QR code pop-up for a 10% app discount; and an open Chromium profile menu on the right (with options like Sign in to Chromium, Passwords and autofill). Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action at (58, 14) completed with a 'success' status but failed to navigate back to the Google flight search results page—confirming the action did not achieve its intended goal. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of stalled progress is repeated mis-targeting of UI elements (e.g., opening the profile menu instead of clicking the back button) and unresolved navigation issues. Since the user specified no questions should be asked, the atomic, verifiable next step is to close the open Chromium profile menu by clicking an empty area of the Agoda page, which will clear the UI obstruction and enable unobstructed access to the browser's back button for subsequent navigation attempts to return to the Google flight search results page. | Single left click on an empty area of the Agoda.com Flights page to close the open Chromium profile menu The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [716, 731, 988, 750]
[2026/02/09 16:02:04] [agent reasoning]: The current screen displays an activated Chromium browser window open to Agoda.com's Flights page in GUI mode. Key elements include the Agoda logo at the top left, the 'Flights' tab selected, 'One-way' option chosen, empty input fields for 'Flying from', 'Flying to', and 'Departure', a blue 'SEARCH FLIGHTS' button, a 'Bundle and Save' banner, a QR code pop-up for a 10% app discount, and an open Chromium profile menu on the right (showing options like 'Sign in to Chromium' and 'Passwords and autofill'). Reviewing the event stream, the previous mouse click action on an empty area of the Agoda page completed with a 'success' status but failed to close the Chromium profile menu—confirming the action did not achieve its intended goal of clearing the UI obstruction. The in-progress todo is 'Execute: Compare prices across different platforms', and the root cause of the ongoing obstruction is the unclosed profile menu, which blocks unobstructed access to browser controls needed to navigate back to the Google flight search results page. Since the user specified no questions should be asked, an atomic, verifiable next step is to click a different unobstructed empty area of the Agoda.com Flights page (further from the profile menu) to attempt closing the open Chromium profile menu, enabling subsequent navigation efforts. | Single left click on a different unobstructed empty area of the Agoda.com Flights page to close the open Chromium profile menu The element involved has a position of [xmin_px, ymin_px, xmax_px, ymax_px] = [507, 444, 541, 478]

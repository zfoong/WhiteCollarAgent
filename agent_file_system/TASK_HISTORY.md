- **Summary:** Conducted a friendly conversational interview with Foong to gather personalization information.

Updated USER.md file with all collected information and confirmed completion with the user.
- **Instruction:** 
Conduct a friendly conversational interview to learn about the user.

Your goal is to gather information to personalize the agent experience:
1. Learn their name and what they do
2. Understand their communication preferences (casual/formal, brief/detailed)
3. Determine how proactive they want you to be
4. Identify what types of actions need their approval

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Be warm and conversational, not robotic
- Ask ONE question at a time and wait for their response
- Acknowledge their answers before asking the next question
- Keep it natural - this is a conversation, not an interrogation
- If they seem uncomfortable, offer to skip questions

After gathering information:
1. Read agent_file_system/USER.md
2. Update USER.md with the collected information using stream_edit
3. You are free to add extra information provided by user while respecting the md file format
4. Send a summary message of what you learned
5. End the task with task_end

Start with a warm greeting and ask what they'd like to be called.

## [2026-01-27T13:14:57.778842] Check and report workspace directory contents
**Task ID:** Check_and_report_workspace_directory_contents_27540e
**Status:** completed
**Created:** 2026-01-27T13:14:57.778842
**Ended:** 2026-01-27T13:23:01.830734
**Summary:** User requested a detailed listing of the workspace directory at C:\Users\zfoong\Desktop\agent\code\git\craftos\white_collar_agent\workspace; the agent produced a full recursive tree with file sizes and modification times.
**Outcome:** Successfully generated and delivered a complete directory tree plus summary counts (22 files, 16 folders) to the user.
**Process:** 1. Acknowledged request via send_message. 2. Verified directory existence with os.listdir. 3. Recursively walked the entire workspace using a custom Python script that collected for every entry: relative path, type (file/dir), size in bytes, and ISO-formatted modification time. 4. Built an in-memory nested dict tree of all items. 5. Formatted the tree with Unicode box-drawing characters, appended human-readable timestamps (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM), and computed totals. 6. Sent the formatted tree and counts to the user. Key findings: root contains business documents (CapTable.pdf, CraftOS Business Plan.docx, Hiring_Plan.xlsx/pdf, Q&A docs in Japanese, White Collar Agent pitch deck), logo variants (4 PNGs), a marketing kit folder (CraftOS_MarketingKit_20260127) with 9 sub-folders (only 01_overview has content: CraftOS_1page_overview_ja.md), an empty Presentations/ folder, a namecard/ folder with 8 image/PSD assets for three people (koyuki, tham, zolo), and three utility folders (data/, reports/, scripts/) plus a tmp/ folder containing task-session working directories. All paths, sizes, and exact timestamps are preserved in the tree output.
**Errors:** None

[2026/02/17 13:42:39] [agent]: That's fascinating! You're developing me - so you're working on AI research. Where are you based?
[2026/02/17 13:42:45] [user]: Fukuoka
[2026/02/17 13:42:54] [agent]: Fukuoka - beautiful city! So you're in Japan Standard Time. How would you like me to communicate with you? Do you prefer casual and friendly, or more formal and professional? Brief responses or detailed explanations?
[2026/02/17 13:43:08] [user]: I live in Fukuoka but I am actually from Malaysia
[2026/02/17 13:43:15] [agent]: Oh, Malaysian living in Fukuoka - that's a great combination of cultures! So, about communication style - do you prefer casual and friendly, or more formal and professional? Brief responses or detailed explanations?
[2026/02/17 13:43:25] [user]: friendly is good
[2026/02/17 13:43:31] [agent]: Friendly it is! Should I proactively suggest tasks and reminders, or would you prefer I wait for your instructions?
[2026/02/17 13:43:44] [user]: be proactive!
[2026/02/17 13:43:51] [agent]: Great! I love being proactive. For which types of actions should I ask your approval first? (e.g., sending messages, scheduling, file changes, or should I just go ahead with most things?)
[2026/02/17 13:44:08] [user]: anythign that involve deleting something
[2026/02/17 13:44:15] [agent]: Got it - I'll always ask before deleting anything. Is there anything else you'd like me to know about you or how you prefer to work?
[2026/02/17 13:46:23] [user]: nahh that's it
[2026/02/17 13:46:56] [agent]: Thanks for sharing all that with me, Foong! I've saved your preferences. Here's what I learned:
- You're Foong, an AI researcher based in Fukuoka, Japan (originally from Malaysia)
- You prefer friendly communication
- You'd like me to be highly proactive with suggestions
- I should always ask before deleting anything

Feel free to update these preferences anytime. How can I help you today?
